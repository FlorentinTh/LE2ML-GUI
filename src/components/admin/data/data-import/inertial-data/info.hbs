<p>You can upload any dataset as a <strong>JSON</strong> or a <strong>CSV</strong> file.
  Since the dataset will be validated during the upload process, it can contains accelerometer, gyroscope and
  magnetometer data. Each sensor must be identified by its short name such as : <strong><code>ACC</code></strong>,
  <strong><code>GYR</code></strong> and <strong><code>MAG</code></strong> respectively. Moreover, each axe for all
  sensors must be identified by its conventionnal name (<strong><code>X</code></strong>,
  <strong><code>Y</code></strong> and <strong><code>Z</code></strong>). Finally, it is important for the last column to
  be named <strong><code>LABEL</code></strong>.</p>
